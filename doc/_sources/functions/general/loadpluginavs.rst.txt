LoadPlugin (Avisynth Compatibility)
===================================

.. function::   LoadPlugin(string path)
   :module: avs

   Load an Avisynth 2.5 (32 bit only), 2.6 (32 and 64 bit) or Avisynth+ (32 and 64 bit) plugin.
   If successful, the loaded plugin's functions will end up in the avs namespace. Note that
   in the case of Avisynth+ there's no way to use the formats combined with alpha or
   higher bitdepth packed RGB. Coincidentally there are no plugins that use this in a
   meaningful way yet.

   The compatibility module can work with a large number of Avisynth's plugins.
   However, the wrapping is not complete, so the following things will cause
   problems:
   
      * The plugin expects YUY2 or RGB32 input. In this case provide input in
        either YUV422P8 or RGB24 format pass compatpack=True as an argument
        to the Avisynth function.
      * The plugin tries to call env->invoke().
        These calls are ignored when it is safe to do so, but otherwise they
        will most likely trigger a fatal error.
      * Plugins trying to read global variables.
        There are no global variables.

   If there are function name collisions functions will have a number appended
   to them to make them distinct. For example if three functions are named
   *func* then they will be named *func*, *func_2* and *func_3*. This means
   that Avisynth functions that have multiple overloads (rare) will give
   each overload a different name.
   
   Note that if you are really insane you can load Avisynth's VirtualDub plugin
   loader and use VirtualDub plugins as well. Function overloads are very common
   when dealing with VirtualDub.

   Beware of Python's escape character, this will fail::

      LoadPlugin(path='c:\plugins\filter.dll')

   Correct ways::
   
      LoadPlugin(path='c:/plugins/filter.dll')
      LoadPlugin(path=r'c:\plugins\filter.dll')
      LoadPlugin(path='c:\\plugins\\filter.dll')
