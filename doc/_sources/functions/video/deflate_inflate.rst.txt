Deflate/Inflate
===============

.. function:: Deflate(vnode clip[, int[] planes=[0, 1, 2], float threshold])
   :module: std

   Replaces each pixel with the average of the eight pixels in its 3x3
   neighbourhood, but only if that average is less than the center pixel.

   *clip*
      Clip to process. It must have integer sample type and bit depth
      between 8 and 16, or float sample type and bit depth of 32. If
      there are any frames with other formats, an error will be
      returned.
      
   *planes*
      Specifies which planes will be processed. Any unprocessed planes
      will be simply copied.

   *threshold*
      Allows to limit how much pixels are changed. Output pixels will not
      become less than ``input - threshold``. The default is no limit.

      become greater than ``input + threshold``. The default is no limit.
